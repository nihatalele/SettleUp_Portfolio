BAND
Overall: (165/180)
Repo: git@github.com:cse3901-2025sp-giles/BANDProject6.git
Documentation: (15/20) What you have in your README is okay.  However, I would like a little content about how to use your application, not just how to run it.  In-code comments are good.
Correctness: (30/35) It's a little odd that someone has to create an account to create a trip but participants just need an email address.  Navigation is a bit clunky, as sometimes
it's tricky to find the right screen to perform a function (like add an expense).  My biggest complaint is that there is no way to see the total list of expenses for a trip.  If you go in through a user you can see the expenses that the person paid, but not the ones that they are on the hook for. 
Functionality/Features: (23/25) I like that you give the option to view a participant's summary before removing them from the trip.  I really like the settle up table at the bottom
What is the purpose of the checkboxes on the settle up table?  Is that supposed to allow us to zero them out?  It doesn't seem to work.
Aesthetics: (17/20) Looks pretty good.  I don't love that so many things take the full width of the page.  Wide boxes with small amounts of information in them seem strange.
Style - HTML/CSS/JS (15/15) Great
Style - Ruby (15/15) Nice job
Design - HTML/CSS/JS (15/15) Thank you for using variables in your stylesheet :)
Design - Ruby/Rails (15/15) No complaints
Presentation (20/20)
Notes: Well done overall.  My only complaints are some less-than-intuitive workflows and the styling.
